    <p>Hello! My name is Palmer Allen, I am a <em>freshman</em> at NC State University.  
     I am a <strong>civil</strong> engineering major. I chose this major becuase of my dad who is a civil engineer. 
     He helped me find what I would like to do as my prefession. I also love the idea of making something that means something.
     This has all added to my decision of becoming a Civil engineer.
    </p>  
    <br />
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; color:#0000FF; font-size:14px; text-align:center;">
    My dream job would be to work as a structual engineer. 
    As a <ins>structual engineer</ins> I would create floor plans for residential areas. 
    I would like to also work on bigger projects such as designing bridges and larger complexes.
    </p>
